# knacksack-problem
It is an algorithmic technique for solving a problem by recursively breaking it down into simpler subproblems, and using the fact that the optimal solution to the overall problem depends upon the optimal solution to it's individual subproblems.

DP algorithm solves each subproblem just once and then remembers its answer, thereby avoiding re-computation of the answer for similar subproblem every time.

It also gives us a life lesson - Make life less complex. 

The knapsack problem is a problem in combinatorial optimization: 
Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible.
